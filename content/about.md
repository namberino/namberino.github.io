Hello, my name is Nam Nguyen, I usually go by Namberino on the Internet. I'm currently an undergraduate (2nd year) in Vietnam. This website was made for me to document what I've learned and share it to the world.

# My Journey (so far)
I've always been interested in computers my entire life. I was first introduced to computer when I was in primary school and I've become quite obsessed with these machines ever since.

I started learning how to code at the start of my high school freshman year. Since then, I've built many different types of software, ranging from *websites* to an operating system *bootloader*. You can find my projects at [[*my GitHub*]](https://github.com/namberino)

Within the field of technology, I've found myself gravitating towards the *cybersecurity* and *low level systems* side. So I've taught myself some *reverse engineering*, some *assembly*, some low level programming and most importantly, how to use *C*.

I also like to mess around with game engines and frameworks to make some games for fun.

When I got into university, my area of interests widened a bit. I became very interested in *robotics* and *electronics*. So I've decided to try learning everything I can about robotics.

Now, I'm dead set on improving my *electronics*, *programming* and *robotics* skills. Since I'm quite broke, most of the hardware stuff that I do and document about will mostly be done in simulation (if I do manage to get my hands on some electronics part, I'll use that instead).
