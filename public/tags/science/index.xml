      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rocketry has always been a fascinating topic for me and I&amp;rsquo;d love to get into model rocketry because it seems so interesting. Unfortunately, due to where I live, I can&amp;rsquo;t really get into it due to lack of materials, cost, and local laws. So what&amp;rsquo;s a guy to do when he wants to get into rocketry but can&amp;rsquo;t physically do it? He goes the virtual simulation route.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be building a simulation for a simple thrust vector control (&lt;strong&gt;TVC&lt;/strong&gt;) rocket. This rocket will be modeled pretty accurately to life, it won&amp;rsquo;t be 100% realistic since it&amp;rsquo;s just a simulation, but it will be mostly correct. I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting everything from start to finish so that anyone who wants to can follow along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fire! But cold</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across some experiment on youtube about something called &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;cold fire&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. It sound contradictory, right? How can fire, something that is inherently hot, be cold? Well, that is what we are going to explore in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fire&#34;&gt;What is fire?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand fire, we need to understand &lt;strong&gt;plasma&lt;/strong&gt;. It is the 4th state of matter, right after gas. When a gas gets extremely hot, the electrons inside a substance have enough energy to detach from their atom and move freely. This makes the atoms become highly charged due to the lack of electrons and they form a collection of charged particles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
