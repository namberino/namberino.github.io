      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen a movie about time travel, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have heard of the term &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Butterfly Effect&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. The Butterfly Effect got its name from a pretty interesting example: The flapping of a butterfly in the present can cause a hurricane in the future. It&amp;rsquo;s used extensively in time travel movies because if you somehow managed to time travel to the past and change the past, the future could be drastically altered from that small change due to how that small change compounded into bigger and bigger changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was bored so I went down the rabbit hole of engineering disasters. One disaster that caught my eyes was the &lt;em&gt;OceanGate&amp;rsquo;s Titan incident&lt;/em&gt;. It caught my eyes because I was curious about how much pressure was applied onto the submarine at that depth, so I grab my calculator and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous thing about deep ocean is probably the hydrostatic pressure. This pressure is proportional to the depth measured from the surface of the water body. The weight of the body of fluid gradually increases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
