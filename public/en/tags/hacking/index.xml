      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some research into reverse engineering for a while now. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been learning about firmware and embedded systems for a long time. And I thought &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool to combine these to skills to do something?&amp;rdquo;. So I decided to try decrypting the encrypted firmware of the a Serial-To-WiFi device. I&amp;rsquo;ve documented my process here in this blog post.&#xA;The device I recently read that there was a vulnerability in the Moxa NPort W2150A Serial-To-Wifi device that exploit stack-based buffer overflow.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Please do NOT use this for malicious intent. This is purely for educational purpose only. If you do want to run this ransomware, run it in an isolated environment. STAY SAFE AND DON&amp;rsquo;T GET IN TROUBLE!&#xA;Ever since I started watching Mr. Robot, I got really interested in hacking and hackers. I&amp;rsquo;m not a hacker myself but I do like learning about how people have found ways to exploit computers.</description>
